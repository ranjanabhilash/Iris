Project Overview
The Iris Classification project involves creating a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three
species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) based on the length and width of their petals and sepals. This is a
classic problem in machine learning and is often used as an introductory example for classification algorithms.

Problem Statement:
● The model should achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying iris species.
● The model's predictions should be consistent and reliable, as measured by cross-validation.
● The final report should provide clear and comprehensive documentation of the project, including all
code, visualizations, and findings.
By achieving these objectives, the project will demonstrate the ability to apply machine learning techniques to a
classic classification problem, providing insights into the characteristics of different iris species and the
effectiveness of various algorithms for this task.
